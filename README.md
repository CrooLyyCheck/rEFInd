# rEFInd
A collection of scripts for installed rEFInd boot loader to simplify rebooting into a specific operating system from another booted OS instance. Particularly useful for dual-boot/multi-boot environments and remotely managed systems without ability to choose boot entry over network.

# ⚠️ Before you start:
- Don't run any scripts without knowing what they do.
  
# Requirements for *.ps1 files
- Powershell compatible windows (for now) if you need for older windows make new issue requesting compability.
- Administrative rights to run scripts as Admin.

# Requirements for *.sh file
- Yhm... Just linux with bash and root/sudo access
- make script to be executable: sudo chmod +x path_to_script.sh
# How to reboot from windows to linux
